            <h3>HELPETIE</h3>
            <p>Helpetie is an application with the main function that helps users to easily contact and report pet rescue cases to rescue centers with just one click of a call button, without having to memorize hotline numbers or wonder how to handle the situation. Helpetie supports users to post and join the community of pet-lovers that desires to help and adopt abandoned or injured animals in need of a new home. Moreover, Helpetie also provides a series of pet care guidance and a list of local and national pet stores and veterinary clinics.</p>

                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                <p>Currently, the number of applications related to animal adoption and rescue in Vietnam is very little or almost none. However, many people have the need to adopt animals from shelters, or they encounter cases of abandoned pets on the street and are very confused since they do not know who to contact and start the process. In addition, animal rescue facilities are also overloaded with the number of animals, as well as having problems in the process of rescuing abandoned cats and dogs due to a lack of information from providers.</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="block">
                <h4>The outcome</h4>
                <p>To solve these problems, we have designed an application to connect pet-lovers with pet rescue centers. From that, the app will provide information about pets in need of a new home to people wanting to adopt, and helps rescue centers to get notifications from local citizens and easily locate abandoned pets on the street. At the same time, it synthesizes information including a list of reputable pet stores and veterinary clinics and provides a series of articles on how to take care of pets at home.</p>
