            <h3>FOUND</h3>
            <p>FOUND is a system that supports the two processes of dealing with wildlife trafficking cases. In the first stage, through the mobile application, FOUND will receive reports from citizens on sightings of wild animals, whether in the form of illegal products or just seeing them being mistreated. Collected data will then be processed and transferred to the web-based form of FOUND. These data will be synthesized and analyzed into statistics reports to create an overview map and a mutual workspace for NGOs and law enforcement departments to work together on this web-based network.</p>

                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                <p>Wildlife trafficking is one of the worldâ€™s most nefarious challenges. It threatens national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law, pushes species to the brink of extinction, and spreads disease. In Vietnam, one of the regional and global hotspots for illegal wildlife trade, wildlife cyber crimes are increasing at an alarming rate on social media platforms.</p>

            <div class="block">   
                <h4>The outcome</h4>
                <p>We developed FOUND - a system aiming at supporting the process of reporting wildlife trafficking situations for citizen and the process of progressing cases for NGOs and other law enforcement departments. FOUND encourages everyone, regardless of age, sex, socioeconomic status, with a smartphone and access to the Internet, to become proactive in reporting illegal wildlife trafficking cases, and law enforcement departments to become responsible for supporting NGOs working in wildlife conservation.</p>
