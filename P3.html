            <h3>all the people on earth</h3>
            <p>A series of self-expression, with collage artworks and poems designed and written by myself. The project
                starts from when I am studying abroad in Netherlands. The series gives a glimpse into my sense of self
                as an abroad student through meeting many different people that have come across my life.</p>

                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                <p>Living alone in a country that is more than 9.000 kilometers away from home land gives me a chance to
                    unlock many hidden parts inside myself and reflect on many unresolved trauma and pains. The design
                    is simply aiming at helping me to see and express myself better, yet to gain a deeper
                    self-identification when I am considered as “a human being with no home”.</p>

                <h4>The outcome</h4>
                <p>The design is a series of postcard-liked artworks formed by combining my written poems with collages
                    that are inspired from them using my own photography.</p>
