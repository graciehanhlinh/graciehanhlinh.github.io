                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                <p>The current website of The Dutch Store is outdated and impractical with a lack of responsiveness,
                    confusing navigation, and buried information.
                    There is a strong need to redesign the website to meet the modern web standards and
                    enhance the purchase experience of the users.</p>
