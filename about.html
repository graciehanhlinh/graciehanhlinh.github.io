            <p>Hi there! So you want to know more about me? Let’s get to know about each other then! <br><br> I’m Hanh
                Linh, but you can call me Grace. I am <span class="rainbow">very queer</span> in my own way. I am a 21
                year old human being that was born and raised in Viet Nam. My pronouns are <span
                    class="emphasize">they/them</span>.<br><br> In 2021, I by chance participated in a small online
                course in UXD and I felt so interested in it.<br> In 2022, I decided to start my proper UXD bachelor
                degree in The Hague, Netherlands.<br> In 2023, I took a minor programme in Interaction Technology with
                the aim of exploring more the technical aspects of the Human-Computer Interaction field.</p>
